this is a very simple website that allows you to play using shasavic music theory thru webmidi.

## credits

i wrote all the code and the fonts and music theory are made by LÎ›MPLIGHT.

i also converted the lapisia font to woff (it was otf originally)

## important info

- this midi controller is monophonic, meaning it can only send one note at a time.
- Ah is tuned to 289.56Hz, so it is in tune with Yxeni.
- this program assumes your synth is tuned to A4=440Hz.
- a lot of numbers are currently hard programmed. i'll add settings for them later though!

for anything not mentioned here feel free to dm me on discord!
